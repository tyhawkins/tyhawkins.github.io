  "body": "# Slack Etiquette\r\nSlack is awesome.  It is truly a step forward in instant messaging.  But it makes it very easy to forget that it's _instant messaging_, and it makes it very easy to break concentration and cause unnecessary woe for your teammates.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this document is to write the unwritten rules of Slacking, making everyone's lives a little easier and a little less stressful.\r\n\r\n### When to Slack (Should I send this through Slack?)\r\nIf you're unsure if you should be Slacking something, chances are it is better served as an email or a phone call.  Don't forget, those still exist and are still excellent methods of communication!\r\n\r\n> In general, if you need the immediate attention of someone and need to wake them if they're sleeping, give them a phone call.\r\n\r\n> If you want to let someone know something that you can reasonably expect them to see in 15 minutes or more, Slack them!  This includes using @here, @channel and @group (see setion 3 for more info).  If it can't wait at least 15 minutes, don't Slack it! Call, or meet with them in-person if necessary.\r\n\r\n> If you want to provide information to large numbers of people, have a discussion between teams in your organization or give someone information that they don't need to immediately act on, use email.\r\n\r\n### Where to Slack (What channel do I use?)\r\n\r\nWhat do you want to say? If it's something meant for one person, and you're fine with waiting at least 15 minutes for them to even see it; send them a direct message! Use emjois if you'd like, but use sparingly (and keep it appropriate ;) ).  Don't send more than one message at a time, and if it takes more than one message to explain what you need, consider emailing instead.\r\n\r\nIf you need to tell a group of people something, or ask them a brief question, see if they have a channel dedicated to their team (some teams have #ask-[groupname]).  These #ask channels **don't** replace any ticket systems you currently have in place.  Think of it like walking into that teams area to have a short discussion.\r\n\r\nIf the aforementioned group is a handful of people from separate teams, use a group message or make a purpose-built private channel if it's going to be an ongoing discussion or project.  Again, this **doesn't** replace any existing ticket systems; think of it like a continuous meeting in a conference room.\r\n\r\nIf you just want to participate in a larger, generalized discussion about a topic like music, sports or a programming language, look for purpose-built channels like `#music` or `#python`.  Use `#general` very sparingly; think of it like posting something to the front door that everyone will see when they walk in the office, and don't use any at commands (@here, @channel) unless it's relevant **and timely** to the *whole* organization (not many things usually are).\r\n\r\n### How to Slack (How should I use Slack?)\r\n\r\nSlacking is easy; almost too easy.  Slack makes it easy to forget that you can directly interrupt hundreds, possibly thousands of people's work.  So with that in mind, keep your messages short and sweet.  Informal is fine, vulgar is not.\r\n\r\n#### A message about at-commands (@here, @channel)\r\n\r\nAt-commands should be used very sparingly.\r\n\r\n> @here **notifies** everyone that's online and not idle\r\n\r\n> @channel **notifies** everyone in the members list\r\n\r\n**Examples of when to use @here:**\r\n>When you are a manager and need all of your employees in the office to respond to the question you're asking, or complete a task ASAP. (example: \"@here Please complete your timesheets by 10AM today\" or \"@here Everyone please grab 15 pieces of flair from the bowl that's being passed around\")\r\n\r\n>When you're making an announcement in a channel about a subject that is like a memo, or FYI.  (example: \"@here We're now going to be including cover sheets on ALL of our TPS reports\")\r\n\r\n**Examples of when not to use @here:**\r\n>When you have a question and you want it answered quickly.\r\n\r\n>When you asked a question 5 minutes ago and have not yet received an answer (expectation for Slack messages is 15 minutes **at least**)\r\n\r\n>When you want to ask everyone a question (Start an email thread, and ask people to respond directly)\r\n   \r\n**Generally, @heres:**\r\n>Must be important to everyone in the channel.\r\n\r\n>Must not be an emergency (emergencies mean use the phones or the fire extinguisher)\r\n\r\n>>An emergency can be loosely defined as a service being down, revenue being impacted, or someone who's title starts with Chief making a request\r\n\r\n@channel should be used even less than @here, as it notifies people who are not online.  This means a push notification on their phone or an email, usually.\r\n\r\n**Examples when to use @channel:**\r\n>When you are a manager and you are notifying everyone that the office is unexpectedly closed tomorrow (should also be used with email and perhaps a phone call if it's a small office)\r\n\r\nAnd that's pretty much it.  Usually, ever other case is probably better suited by a phone call or email, or just posting the message without forcing everyone to read it ASAP.\r\n\r\n### Last Thoughts\r\n\r\nSlack increases productivity, reduces barriers to cross-team communication, and boosts synergy.  Respect your coworker's time and attention on Slack and it will continue to be the best way to coordinate and keep your organization running smoothly.",
